The following script contains functionality for providing the application an automated email service. This acts behalf on mostly the admin users of the application and allows them to invite patients to using the up or signing up. The issue encountered was that in order to send to any unauthorized email such as a private one, an owned and authenticated domain was required to be assessed and accepted by Amazon in order to meet email standards compliance. Because we did not yet make an official domain for testing purposes the SES script cannot send to most emails. However, The functionality is installed and prepared for the event of a domain being registered where the client sees fit. Therefore beyond acquisition of a registered domain testing and assignment of the script will result in expected functionality and use case fufilments.
